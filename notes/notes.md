	2.	Warmup and Cooldown Structure Differences:
	•	In the generated file, “warmup” and “cooldown” include “intervals” lists, which seems correct based on the desired output. However, the generated structure seems to differ in how these intervals are formatted, and some redundant fields (like music) are appearing multiple times.
	3.	Timer Entries and Repetition:
	•	The “intervalRest” field and “music” attributes appear to be duplicated or inconsistent. The generated JSON has these fields in different sections compared to the example.
	•	The original example has a different organization for “cooldown” and “warmup” exercises inside timers. The generated version does not exactly follow this structure, and some “cooldown” and “warmup” interval properties are mixed or duplicated.
	4.	Attributes in a Different Order:
	•	The generated JSON file has attributes in a different order than the example. While JSON technically doesn’t require a specific order, it may still be important for visual consistency.
	5.	Nested Timer Details:
	•	In some cases, like the “intervals” inside the “warmup” or “cooldown” sections, the structure doesn’t align precisely with the example. The generated file sometimes includes details that should only appear at a higher level.



	1.	Top-Level “music” Settings:
	•	The “music” settings at the top level may not match exactly, possibly due to missing or reordered fields.
	2.	“timerRest” Section:
	•	The “music” field in the “timerRest” section may not be consistent with the original structure, either in terms of field order or content.
	3.	“warmup” and “cooldown” Sections:
	•	The “music” objects or other fields within “warmup” and “cooldown” might differ from the original, including potential discrepancies in field order or missing fields.
	4.	“circuitRest” Section:
	•	The “circuitRest” section might have variations in its “music” settings or other fields compared to the original.
	5.	Within “timers” Array:
	•	In the “timers” array, the nested “music” objects within subsections like “intervalRest,” “warmup,” and “cooldown” may not consistently match the original structure.

Sections That Seem Fine:

	•	“intervals” List:
	•	Based on the provided details, the “intervals” list itself doesn’t seem to have major structural issues beyond potential variations in nested “music” settings.
