Generate a HIIT workout plan in JSON format with the following structure. Only include the JSON content in your response:

The warmup should last 5-7 minutes total. Pick 2-10 light activities that appropriately warm up for the main workout. Rest between intervals should be about half that of the timer.

The main workout should represent a HIIT workout lasting 15 minutes. Intervals could last between 20 and 40 seconds and go in a circuit. Tabata should be true.

Cooldown should be similar to warmup but instead be longer active stretches focusing on the muscles used in the main workout.
